DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT!!

There is an increase in cycling culture around the world and automated cycle renting systems are being set up.
Cycles are taken from one stop and dropped at any other stop.
Cycles are used depending on many features such as weather, month, year.
Being able to predict the requirement of cycles will optimise the cycle renting systems.
They will help to use the right number of cycles and make the most out of them.
This is the problem that we have solved.
We have build a model that will predict the number of cycles required/consumed each day.
We have used a SVR model which will show the prediction for the given input of date and a few more parameters.
This project aims to optimize the number of cycles at a stop by taking into consideration factors such as day of the week, weather etc.
